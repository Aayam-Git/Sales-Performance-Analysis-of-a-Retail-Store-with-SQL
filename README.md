# Sales-Performance-Analysis-of-a-Retail-Store-with-SQL
Deep-dive analysis of retail transaction data to uncover actionable business insights

## Project Overview
This project involves a deep-dive analysis of retail transaction data to uncover actionable business insights. As a Business Analyst, my goal was to transform raw sales records into a structured database, perform rigorous data cleaning, and execute complex SQL queries to identify trends, high-value customers, and departmental performance.

## Core Objectives
- Infrastructure: Architected a relational database schema to house 1,000+ retail transactions.

- Data Quality Assurance: Performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to identify and handle missing values, ensuring data integrity for downstream reporting.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted descriptive statistics to understand customer demographics and purchasing power.

- Business Intelligence: Developed SQL scripts to solve real-world business problems regarding sales seasonality and customer segmentation.

## Key Business Findings
- Revenue Concentration: The 'Clothing' and 'Beauty' sectors contributed to over 60% of total revenue.

- Customer Loyalty: The top 5 customers contributed significantly to total sales, suggesting a need for a targeted retention program.

- Operational Efficiency: The 'Evening' shift consistently handles the highest volume of transactions, indicating a need for optimized staffing during these hours.
